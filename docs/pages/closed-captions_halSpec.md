## Description

This `HAL` provides an interface to the `caller` to start and stop the closed caption data acquisition with video decoder handle as the input.

## Component Runtime Execution Requirements

These requirements ensure that this interface executes correctly within the run-time environment that it will be used in.
Since closed caption data is coming from video decoder, make sure that video decoders are initialized and available for further operations before the Closed Caption module is up.

### Initialization and Startup

`Caller` must call `vlhal_cc_Register()` before calling any other `API`. Any platform specific initialization can be done from `media_closeCaptionStart()`. `Caller` must have complete control over the lifecycle of this interface (from start to stop).

### Threading Model

This interface is required to be thread-safe.

### Process Model

The interface is expected to support a single instantiation with a single process.

### Memory Model

Closed Captions `HAL` is responsible for its own memory management. The buffer used to pass closed caption data through `ccDataCallback()` must be managed after the callback returns.

### Power Management Requirements

This interface is not required to be involved in any power management funtionality.

### Asynchronous Notification Model

Events `CONTENT_PRESENTING_EVENT` and `PRESENTATION_SHUTDOWN_EVENT` must be conveyed to the caller to indicate start and stop of closed caption decoding respectively. These events are sent using `ccDecodeCallBack()` function.

### Blocking calls

The following callbacks may be blocked depending on the `caller's` internal operations, but will need to be returned within a few milliseconds.

  1. `ccDataCallback()` - Invoked whenever new closed caption data is available
  2. `ccDecodeCallBack()` - Invoked during start and stop of closed caption datÂ§a decoding
 
### Internal Error Handling

All `APIs` must return errors synchronously as a return argument. The interface is responsible for managing its internal errors.

### Persistence Model

There is no requirement to persist any settings information.

## Non-functional requirements

The following non-functional requirements are required to be supported by this interface:

### Logging and debugging requirements

This interface is required to support DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, TRACE and ERROR messages. INFO, TRACE and DEBUG should be disabled by default and enabled when required.

### Memory and performance requirements

This interface is required to use only minimal memory/`CPU` resources while in stopped state.

### Quality Control

* This interface is required to perform static analysis, our preferred tool is Coverity.
* Have a zero-warning policy with regards to compiling. All warnings are required to be treated as errors.
* Copyright validation is required to be performed, e.g.: Black duck, FossID.
* Use of memory analysis tools like Valgrind are encouraged to identify leaks/corruptions.
* `HAL` Tests will endeavour to create worst case scenarios to assist investigations.
* Improvements by any party to the testing suite are required to be fed back.

### Licensing

The closed caption header file license is RDK M.

### Build Requirements

This interface is required to be built into shared library. The shared library must be named `librdkCCReader.so`. The building mechanism must be independent of Yocto.

### Variability Management

Any new `API` introduced should be implemented by all the 3rd party modules. Currently there is little to no variability expected across various implementations. Any change to the interface must be reviewed and approved by component architects and owners.

### Platform or Product Customization

This interface is not required to have any platform or product customizations.


## Interface API Documentation

`API` documentation is provided via doxygen comments in the header file.

### Theory of operation

`Caller` will initialize closed captions `HAL` interface with the callback functions, decoder index and video decoder handle. The value of decoder index will be zero always, and this value will be passed back in the ccDataCallback() and ccDecodeCallBack() functions. `HAL` will deliver closed caption data packets via the registered callbacks aligned with the corresponding video frame.The `HAL` can read data directly from the driver or by registering a call back function based on the platform `API` support. As per the spec, closed caption data packet is sent in this byte order :  cc_type,cc_data_1,cc_data_2. `HAL` must check `process_cc_data_flag` bit as per [CEA-708/CEA-608 spec](#references) and must ignore the packets with this flag set to 0. The `HAL` must parse the `cc_valid` bit as per [CEA-708/CEA-608 spec](#references) and only the packets with `cc_valid` set to 1 must be sent to the `caller`.

Following is a typical sequence of operation:
1. Register callbacks using  `vlhal_cc_Register()`.
2. Start closed caption data decoding using `media_closeCaptionStart()`. The interface will continuously deliver closed caption data to `caller` in real time via callback `ccDataCallback()`.
4. When the closed caption data is no longer needed, stop caption decoding using `media_closeCaptionStop()`. This will stop the `HAL` callbacks.
5. Start and stop of decoding is notified to the `caller` using `ccDecodeCallBack()`.
6. `vlhal_cc_DecodeSequence()` can be called to get the decode sequence number whenever required.
